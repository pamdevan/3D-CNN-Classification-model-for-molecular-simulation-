The simulation datasets are large memory files that exceed the allowable capacity to be hosted on GitHub.
Therefore they have been hosted on a publicly accessible Google Drive link as follows:

There are two zip files

1. "Datasets.rar" contains the reactant and product profiles of the cellobiose system at 4 different temperatures.
2. "Volumetric map data.rar" contains the volume densities of the reactant cellobiose, as well as its condensed-phase that is treated as the solvent, at each of the 4 different temperatures. These files are in the .dx format
